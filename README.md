### Hi there 👋

😄 I'm a Biologist and a Developer/Bioinformatician in development.

🔭 I’m currently working on my PhD thesis, which is about Leukemia/DNA mutation/Chromosomes 3D organization. There is a lot of programming involved.

🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Pandas, Numpy, SQL, Statistics and Machine Learning on Ada. I've been working with Bash for quite some time now.
